            <i>The protection and security of personal data is a top priority for us. Therefore, we strictly adhere to the rules of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).

            access date and time of the server request and the file request of the client (file name and URL). This data is only collected for statistical analysis.
            It will not be passed on to third parties for commercial or non-commercial purposes.</br>
            <b>2. Use of personal data</b></br> Personal data is only collected or processed if you this information is voluntary, e.g. in the context of an inquiry.
            If there are no necessary reasons in connection with a business transaction, you can revoke the previously granted approval of your personal data storage at any
            time with immediate effect in writing (e.g. by email or fax). Your data will not be passed on to third parties, unless a transfer is required due to legal regulations.</br>
